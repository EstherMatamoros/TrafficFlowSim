# Traffic Flow Simulation with Pygame

This project simulates the flow of traffic at an intersection with pedestrians, using the Pygame library. The simulation includes images of pedestrians walking in all four directions (up, down, left, right), as well as images of vehicles (bus, car, motorcycle, truck) also moving in all four directions. Additionally, there are images of traffic lights (green, red, yellow) for both cars and pedestrians.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, you will need to have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/) and Pygame from the Pygame website (https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

Once you have Python and Pygame installed, you can run the simulation by running the "simulation v-p.py" file. This file can be found in the main project folder.

## File Structure

The project includes the following folders:
- `Pdirection`: contains images of pedestrians in all four directions
- `images`: contains images of vehicles (bus, car, motorcycle, truck) in all four directions
- `signals`: contains images of traffic lights (green, red, yellow) for cars and pedestrians

## Simulation Features

The simulation includes the following features:
- Realistic movement of vehicles and pedestrians based on traffic light signals
- Counts the number of violations made by cars, which occurs when a vehicle hits a pedestrian

## Conclusion

This project provides a fun and interactive way to learn about traffic flow and pedestrian safety. Enjoy experimenting with different scenarios and see the impact of different traffic light patterns on the movement of vehicles and pedestrians.

Please note that this simulation is for educational and entertainment purposes only and should not be used to make real-world decisions regarding traffic flow and pedestrian safety.
